# The usage of the .gitattributes file is mainly based on the because of Cross-Platofrm Development. 
# Different operating systems use different line-ending conventions (LF for Linux/macOS, CRLF for Windows). 
# Without .gitattributes, inconsistent line endings can cause issues when collaborating across platforms.
##
# If a developer on Windows commits a file with CRLF line endings, and another developer on Linux checks it out, 
# the .gitattributes file ensures that the line endings are normalized to LF in the repository and converted back 
# to the appropriate format on checkout. This helps maintain consistency and avoids issues like unnecessary diffs
# caused by line-ending mismatches.
